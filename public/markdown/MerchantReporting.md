## Reporting

### Transaction Report

Transaction Reporting displays all card placement attempts and relevant data (final status, date completed, etc.)

You can also generate a CSV report of all card placement activity between the specified dates. If your user settings include access to all FIs ("All FIs" checkbox), this will show activity for all FIs in the instance. Otherwise, it will only show singularly assigned FI.

To generate the report, simply select the beginning and ending dates you would like and click Generate Report. The report will download to your device.

### Session Report

Session Reporting lists all active and closed cardholder sessions. A session remains open until the cardholder has been inactive for 15 minutes or clicks the Done button. 
The clickstream object shows the overall journey of the cardholder by logging important momemnts in the CardUpdatr workflow. The clickstream object can be viewed in its entirety by clicking the View button. Additionally, the four different locations tracked in the clickstream are broken out into four separate columns in the display/report; these columns display the first time that the cardholder visited the location. The columns are defined as follows: 

| Column Name | Definition |
|----------|----------|
| Select Merchant | Upon loading of the site selection page. |
| Missing Fields | Upon appearance of the missing fields modal (if additional information was required by the selected sites). |
| User Data Collection | Upon loading of the user data collection page. |
| Credential Entry | Upon loading of the credential entry page. |

The number of succcessful jobs versus total jobs is also tracked. The detailed information for each job can be accessed with the View button.

To generate a CSV report showing cardholder session data for a certain date range, select your beginning and ending dates and click Generate Report. The report will download to your device.

### Merchant Site Report
The Merchant Sites tab lists all merchant sites, their current active status, and the user data information that each site requires.

To generate a CSV report of this data, click Generate Report. The report will download to your device.
