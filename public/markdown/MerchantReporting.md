## Merchant Reporting

The Merchant Reporting tab displays all card placement attempts and relevant data (final status, date completed, etc.)

You can also generate a CSV report of all card placement activity between the specified dates. If you are logged in within the Admin FI, this will show activity for all FIs in the instance. Otherwise, it will only show your FI.

To generate the report, simply select the beginning and ending dates you would like and click Generate Report. The report will download to your device.
