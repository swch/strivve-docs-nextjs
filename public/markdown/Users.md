## Users
The users tab shows all users in the FI of the logged in user. If you are logged in to the Admin FI, you will see users for all FIs. Users can also be added, edited, or deleted here.

##### Add/Edit a User
To edit a user, click the pencil icon beside the user you wish to edit. 

###### Role
A user's role determines their permissions within the CardSavr API. A user may have the following roles:

**admin** : 
- admins are Partner Portal-specific users that can create, edit, and delete any cardholder within their FI. 

**cardholder agent** :
- create cardholders
- create cards/addresses for those cardholders
- create accounts for those cardholders
- post jobs for those cardholders
- poll jobs for messages and respond to them on behalf of cardholders they created.

**customer_agent** :
- customer_agents have the same capabilities as cardholder_agents, but they can act on any cardholder within their FI (unless they are assigned to the admin FI, in which case they can act on any cardholder).

##### Delete User
To delete a user, click the trash can next to the user you would like to delete.`
