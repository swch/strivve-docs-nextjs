These resources provide information regarding the integration, implemenation, and operation for the CardUpdatr and
CardSavr products.  

The fastest way to get your integration up and running is to use our 
[Strivve SDK's](/api-sdk/introduction) or, if your environment has signing disabled, 
you can use the [Postman Samples](/api-sdk/using-postman) to place your first
card at a merchant site.
 
Weâ€™ve attempted to make this documentation user-friendly but if you have any questions, 
please contact us at support@strivve.com. 

## Glossary
