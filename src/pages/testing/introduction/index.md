## Testing Your Integrations
CardSavr provides synthetic merchant sites within non-production environments .  
These sites allow you to test your CardSavr integration without using live merchant sites.

## Explore CardSavr API With Postman

CardSavr environments can be configured to work with tools such as Postman, curl, etc.  A Postman template collection of requests is available along with usage instructions at GitHub for the [Strive SDK Postman Samples](https://github.com/swch/Strivve-SDK/tree/master/postman-samples "Strivve-SDK") to aide in exploring the CardSavr API.

## Synthetic Sites
To help test Merchant Site compatabilty, Strivve uses Synthetic Sites to emulate site behaviors.  Synthetic Sites are simple responsive web applications that support a number of different interactive use cases.  For example, you can emulate a TFA (One-Time-Password) within your system.
