# Overview

The [Strivve CardSavr Platform](/guides/architecture) utilizes a Defense-in-Depth best practice model combined with strong cryptography rather than a hard shell and soft center strategy. Network and compute infrastructure isolation is achieved through separate Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) environments, subnets within a CDE and compute resource access schemes; implemented using AWS Accounts, AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), AWS Security Groups/Identity and Access Management (IAM) and AWS Network Access Control (NACLs) respectively. 

CardSavr processes sensitive data including Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Card Holder Data (CHD) and Secure Authentication Data (SAD); as well as Merchant Credentials (MC)for each site a card holder has a relationship with. It is incumbent upon CardSavr to provide integrity and confidentiality of data transiting through it and persistently stored by it. PCI-DSS certified best practice cryptography is utilized within CardSavr to provide the necessary security for this data.

# System Security

## Network Security Layers
These layers are designed to protect authorized card holder data in flight between financial institution applications and the API server; data in flight between services within the CDE and data in flight between the CDE and external systems such merchant sites and operational support systems.

First order confidentiality and integrity of authorized API data including card holder data is done utilizing Transport Layer Security with a minimum version 1.2 (TLS 1.2) protocol configured with best practice strong cryptography FIPS 140-2 Suite B ciphers and hashes. Certificates issued by the Amazon CA using RSA 2048-bit keys are used to establish secure sessions; preferred cipher suite advanced elliptic curve ECDHE 256-bit key exchange is used for perfect forward secrecy of AES-GCM encryption for confidentiality; and SHA 256-bit hashing is used for integrity. Additional confidentiality and integrity is provided to thwart potential Man in the Middle (MiTM) threats to TLS by the API security Layer for second order protection.

Infiltration defense is provided by the AWS Application Load Balancer coupled with best practice AWS Security Group Policies and Network Access Control (NACLs) for access to and within a CDE. Exfiltration defense is provided by NACLs for the CDE VPC subnets. Recurring penetration tests and network scans are performed by PCI authorized vendors to verify these vulnerabilities don't creep into CardSavr.

Cardholder and MC data in flight between Autonomous Browsers (aka Virtual Browsers) and merchant sites is protected by TLS Version 1.2 or Version 1.3 and strong cipher suites. Additionally, the Autonomous Browsers are configured to accept only server certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CA). Self-signed certificates are explicitly not allowed.

## API Security Layers
These layers are designed to provide authentication of applications, authentication of users, second order confidentiality and integrity of in-flight card holder data, and authorization to access API endpoints and card holder data.

### Dual Identify Authentication
API Authentication of an application is employed by signing all API requests/responses to verify the authenticity of applications and prevent rogue application access. Signing uses an HMAC with 256-bit shared secret keys. Each approved application has a unique key generated by the CardSavr Partner Portal service. These application keys are rotated on a schedule configured by the Partner. The application key is used with the HMAC signing during the initialization of an API session, including authentication of the application user. Once the application user is authenticated, a new ephemeral session key is created using an ECDHE key exchange, and this new session key is used for the remainder of the session for API HMAC signing and encryption. This strategy mitigates MiTM attacks through discovery of an application key by changing the session key to one that is not discoverable by the attacker. The only sensitive information that can be discovered by this MiTM attack is an application's name, and a user's name. A userâ€™s password is never transmitted. CardSavr uses a zero-knowledge proof method like Kerberos 5 for authenticity in which the password provided by the user is used by the application to generate a PBKDF2 key to sign the salt provided by the API server for the session that can be verified by the API server.

### Application Data Integrity and Confidentiality
API application data integrity is provided by the HMAC signature for each request/response. API application data confidentiality is provided by AES-CBC 256-bit encryption using the current session key; initially the application key and then subsequently the ephemeral key for perfect forward secrecy (PFS) of all data for the remainder of the session.

### Additional Exfiltration Protection
CardSavr provides additional exfiltration security for PCI-DSS SAD and Merchant Credentials. Payment card PAN and CVV are write-only properties (part of a POST) and cannot be read by applications. Payment cards stored in CardSavr are referenced by the industry standard Payment Account Reference (PAR) mechanism. Merchant credentials are also write-only properties (part of a POST or PUT) and cannot be read by applications. These write only restrictions are in place to prevent accidental or ill intent disclosure of this sensitive information.

### Authorization Roles
Authorization to access CardSavr services including cardholder data is done using roles. The combination of the authenticated application name coupled with the authenticated username is mapped to a role. Each API endpoint and specific properties of an end point, have access control restricted by role.

### Persistent Data Security Layers
These layers provide access control, confidentiality and integrity to cardholder data at rest.

### Data Base Security
Access control to the AWS RDS database is provided by AWS Security Group Policies and NACLs and by default is limited to only the CardSavr API Server and Strivve tooling machinery. Additionally deeper packet infiltration/exfiltration is controlled by NACLs at the subnet boundary.

Confidentiality and integrity of the entire database for all card holders is provided by the RDS service utilizing AES 256-bit encryption using keys managed by AWS Key Management System (KMS) for each CDE VPC.

### Strivve Safe Security
In addition to AES-256 encryption of the entire database, confidentiality and integrity of CHD/SAD and MC at a record level in the database for each card holder is provided by the Strivve Safe using AES-256-CBC encryption. In addition to the PCI critical security properties, the Strivve Safe also includes credentials for each site a card holder utilizes their card or cards with. The Strivve Safe is implemented as an encrypted blob for each of these sensitive records.

Security of the Strivve Safe is provided by using a unique key for each card holder that is PBKDF2 derived by mixing a pair of keys. Strivve provides a unique key for a CDE protected by AWS KMS and the partner generates/maintains a per card holder unique key that is sent on each API transaction request needing access to the Strivve Safe. The derived Strivve Safe key is used to encrypt and decrypt safe items using the AES-256-CBC algorithm. The per cardholder key is stored by partners in their own infrastructure for persistent cardholder users and by CardSavr for short lived ephemeral cardholder users. Persistent cardholder keys are zeroized from memory upon the completion of the transaction it was provided for. This dual key mix provides additional security by requiring both keys be available to unlock (decrypt) the safe.

# Cryptography
PCI-DSS certified best practice cryptography is utilized within CardSavr to provide the necessary security for this data.

## Data In Flight
CardSavr inherently handles data in flight over the public internet; both between applications using the CardSavr RESTful API and with merchant sites it places and updates payment cards on.

### TLS Protection
All network traffic between CardSavr and external systems including applications, merchant sites and operational support systems, utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC-8447] to provide integrity and confidentiality of the data. CardSavr requires a minimum TLS version 1.2, utilizing only safe cipher suites and prefers Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) cipher suites. When acting in the client role, only trusted Certificate Authority certificates are accepted from servers it communicates with.

### Additional REST API Protection
In addition to TLS protection, all CardSavr RESTful API requests and responses are signed, verified and encrypted. Signing is done using the HMAC/SHA256 [RFC 4868] algorithm and encryption is done using the AES-CBC algorithm, both with 256-bit keys. Additionally, one time API session keys are automatically created after login using the ECHDE/P256 [RFC-8422] algorithm for perfect forward secrecy (PFS) protection of all data in transit with CardSavr. This additional layer of security is to thwart any Man in The Middle (MiTM) attacks made upon it, the following diagram illustrates cryptographic protection of data flowing through CardSavr.

### API Session Secret Key
All encryption and signing in in CardSavr is done using a symmetric shared 256-bit key known as the API Session Secret Key. See the API Session keys information on the API Session Secret Key lifecycle later in this document.

### Decryption
All responses from CardSavr are encrypted by the method described in encryption. To decrypt a response, follow the procedure below:

1. Parse API response JSON body.encryptedBody parameter tuple string (Base64-Encrypted-JSON-Body$Base64-IV) into encrypted body component and initialization vector (IV) components (as separated by the '$' delimiter)

2. Convert the Base64-Encrypted-JSON-Body into binary

3. Convert the Base64-IV into binary

4. Create cipher from the AES-256-CBC algorithm, using binary shared API Session Secret Key and decoded IV (from step 3)

5. Decrypt decoded binary body (from step 2) using the cipher from step 4

#### SDK Decryption Support
The [CardSavr API SDK](api-sdk/introduction) takes care of this decryption process. Applications which directly use the [CardSavr REST API](https://swch.github.io/slate/#introduction) must perform these cryptographic operations per the CardSavr API reference documentation.

### Encryption
CardSavr applications and CardSavr will encrypt request and response bodies, respectively, using the API Session Secret Key. As a result, the encrypted payloads can only be decrypted by CardSavr or the user.

You must encrypt the body of your request using 256-bit, Advanced Encryption Standard cipher block chaining (i.e. AES-CBC-256), a 16-byte, cryptographically strong initialization vector, and the API Session Secret Key.

Finally, when placed in your request, the encrypted request body must be combined with the base64-encoded initialization vector that was used to encrypt it. The two values must be separated by a '$' delimiter, illustrated below:

request.body.encryptedBody = Base64-Encrypted-JSON-Body$Base64-IV

To send your request, put this value into your request body object in the property encryptedBody.

#### SDK Encryption Support
The [CardSavr API SDK](api-sdk/introduction) takes care of this encryption process. Applications which directly use the [CardSavr REST API](https://swch.github.io/slate/#introduction) must perform these cryptographic operations per the CardSavr API reference documentation.

### Signing
CardSavr requires signing for all requests and responses to ensure identity and integrity verification. Signing is implemented by three headers--nonce, signature, and authorization--that must be sent with each request and response.

#### Authorization Header
The authorization header contains the integrator name and a prefix:

"Authorization": 'SWCH-HMAC-SHA256 Credentials=' + integrator name

Example: "Authorization: SWCH-HMAC-256 Credentials=MyAgentApplication"

#### Nonce Header
The nonce header contains the current UTC time in milliseconds and therefore provides protection against replay attacks.

"Nonce": UTC in milliseconds

#### Signature Header
The string-to-sign format is: StringToSign = relative-URL-Path (decoded) + Headers.Authorization + Headers.Nonce + Request Body, where URL-Path is the decoded relative endpoint you are calling.

To complete the signature, pass the string-to-sign to an HMAC SHA256 algorithm along with the API Session Secret Key. Place this result value Base64 encoded in the signature header.

"Signature": Base64(HMAC-SHA256(API-Session-Secret-Key, StringToSign))

SDK Signing Support
The [CardSavr API SDK](api-sdk/introduction) takes care of this signing process. Applications which directly use the [CardSavr REST API](https://swch.github.io/slate/#introduction) must perform these cryptographic operations per the CardSavr API reference documentation.

### Verification
To verify a response, perform the same process as signing to derive the signature, base64 encodes the 256-bit result and compares it with the value in Headers.Signature.

#### SDK Verification Support
The [CardSavr API SDK](api-sdk/introduction) takes care of this verification process. Applications which directly use the [CardSavr REST API](https://swch.github.io/slate/#introduction) must perform these cryptographic operations per the CardSavr API reference documentation.

## Data At Rest
CardSavr needs to persistently store confidential data including PII, CHD, SAD and MC. At a minimum, this data must be persistently stored on a temporary basis to perform payment card updates on merchant sites. Optionally, at the discretion of CardSavr applications, this data may be stored on a longer-term basis.

### Database Protection
All data at rest is stored within an AWS Aurora Postgres database. The entire database is encrypted using AWS 256-bit cryptography to maintain integrity and confidentiality while at rest.

### Additional Credential Protection
In addition to the CardSavr data base being AES-256 encrypted, PCI-DSS SAD and MC are stored as encrypted blobs within the data base; known collectively as a per user Strivve Safe employing the AWS-256-CBC algorithm with keys derived by mixing an internal CardSavr environment key with a Cardholder key that is provided by the application. This dual key system employs a strategy of persistently storing the pair in separate environments; CardSavr and partner to prevent disclosure with persistent material from within CardSavr.

For each card placement job, a unique ephemeral Job Safe is created containing PCI-DSS SAD card information and MC for the merchant site. This safe is stored as a blob encrypted using the AES-256-CBC algorithm with a one-time use key and exists only for the duration of a job.

## Cryptographic Keys
For cryptographic signing, verification, encryption and decryption to work, keys need to be used with the various algorithms. These algorithms are only as secure as their key number randomness as all keys generated by CardSavr use key stretching derivation algorithms in order to yield acceptable entropy. All keys persistently stored within CardSavr are encrypted while at rest by key hierarchies protected by a secure root key. All keys other than those used in validating TLS certificates are symmetric 256-bit in length.

### CardSavr API Session Keys
All applications must identify and authenticate themselves with CardSavr. This authentication is independent of the user of the application, who must also separately authenticate themselves. The application authentication serves two purposes: 

1.	To allow only authorized applications to use CardSavr 

2.	To provide integrity and confidentiality to all CardSavr API requests and responses by digitally signing and verifying them. CardSavr uses a shared API session secret key to encrypt and sign requests and responses.

#### Integrator Keys - API Session Initial Shared Secret Key
Every application has a unique name and a unique 256-bit key, known as an integrator key. All CardSavr API requests utilize a custom authentication header method which includes the application name and include a signature header using the integrator key to generate a signature and to verify a returning signature for the user login phase of requests. This initial key must be used by the integrator application as the shared key for the /session/start and /session/login endpoints. Upon successful login, the /session/login endpoint will respond with the server's public elliptic curve point 256-bit key, which must then be used to compute the new API session shared secret key to be used for all other calls to CardSavr during a session.

If a partner is using the Partner Portal, their integrators' initial shared secret keys are automatically generated when created. Aside from the Partner Portal, integrators can be created using the POST /integrators endpoint.

#### Integrator Key Rotation
Integrator keys need to be rotated on a regular basis per PCI-DSS compliance. Partners are responsible for rotating their own keys in accordance with their own PCI-compliant policies. Rotation must be done programmatically via the PUT /integrators endpoint or manually via the Partner Portal.

#### Ephemeral API Session Keys
CardSavr uses an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) key exchange to generate an ephemeral shared secret key known to only CardSavr and the client. This key is used to encrypt, decrypt, and sign all requests and responses to and from CardSavr post login. The diagram below shows how a Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used to generate a new ephemeral API session shared secret key (using paint as a metaphor).
