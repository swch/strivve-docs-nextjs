## CardSavr API

Full integration is provided by CardSavr [SDK's and/or REST API's](/api-sdk/introduction).  This allows complete control of the card placement experience provided by you application while authoring your own desired U/X design.

Please also see Strivve's [Minimizing User Wait Time](/integrations/user_wait_time) document.

### CardUpdatr

CardUpdatr operates in 3 major modes:
* Overlay that appears on top of an existing page.
* Web linked to and from the CardSavr platform, within any web or mobile application
* Embedded into a page or area of a page within any web or mobile application
* Single Sign On for pulling card and billing address details from the banking application systems to avoid cardholder friction and minimize cardholder inputs

For more information, see the [CardUpdatr Documentation](/integrations/cardupdatr).
