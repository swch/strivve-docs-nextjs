title: Strivve Integrations Introduction
---

## CardSavr API

Full integration is provided by CardSavr [SDK's and/or REST API's](/api-sdk/introduction).  This allows complete control of the card placement experience provided by you application while authoring your own desired U/X design.

Please also see Strivve's [Minimizing User Wait Time](/integrations/user_wait_time) document.

## Strivve Components

Strivve's CardSavr Platform has pre-built components that make integrating to the Strivve platform faster and easier.

In many cases, both for prototyping and for production applications, using Strivve's pre-built components hides the complexities of the API's and come with tested and integrated functionality, saving the integration and testing efforts considerably.

There are two basic types of components available for use with the CardSavr Platform today.
* CardUpdatr: A Desktop and mobile iFrame workflow which comes with many configuration options and modes of operation.
* StrivveCX: Varying levels of customizable Javascript Components which easily drop into desktop and mobile web applications as well as native applications as reqired.

### CardUpdatr

CardUpdatr operates in 3 major modes:
* Overlay that appears on top of an existing page.
* Web linked to and from the CardSavr platform, within any web or mobile application
* Embedded into a page or area of a page within any web or mobile application
* Single Sign On for pulling card and billing address details from the banking application systems to avoid cardholder friction and minimize cardholder inputs

For more information, see the [CardUpdatr Documentation](/integrations/cardupdatr).
