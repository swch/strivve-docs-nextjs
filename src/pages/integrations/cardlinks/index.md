## Overview

Strivve CardLinks is a low-cost integration method that provides a web linked solution that can leveraged target a groups of Cardholders outside of digital banking.  Consider the following use case:

1.    The Issuer builds a campaign in their Customer Data Platform (CDP) and builds a Cardholder Targets Dataset 
2.    Using the Strivve Partner Portal, the Issuer specifies and provisions card-on-file datasets into the secure Strivve PCI-DSS compliant platform.  After the information is securely stored, the tool will return a unique Cardholder target URL for each Cardholder data record. 
3.    The resulting URLs are imported into the CDP solution by the Issuer where the URL is embedded into the Issuerâ€™s Card-on-File marketing campaign as a primary call-to-action.
4.    Each link would represent the entry point for a personal card-on-file flow provided by CardUpdatr.
5.    Campaign is launched using the CDP solution.
6.    Cardholder clicks through the call-to-action.  Upon the launch of the CardUpdatr, the Cardholder will need to respond to a challenge (whether specifying the CVV, Zip code, 
One-Time-Password, or other) before continuing to place cards.
7.    Upon successful authorization, the Cardholder places the card on file with Strivve.
8.    The URLs (and corresponding datasets in the Strivve Platform), will expire either at the end of the Campaign, by a specified expiration date, or other configuration in the Campaign Tool.
