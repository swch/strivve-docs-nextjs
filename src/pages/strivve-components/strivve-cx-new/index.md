## Configuration


## Customize
The StrivveCX library comes in the form of Javascript packages for the most popular NodeJS and browser frameworks.

StrivveCX is built for use by Mobile Web and Desktop Web Applications, as well as Native Mobile applications alike.  Applications can dynamically compose and of course consume Javascript components at a minimum, or complete DOM object components also.  Optimally whether the applications are native applications or browser based applications, the StrivveCX components can provide complete components or partial object only components.  However, most applications can compose and consume StrivveCX rich DOM components by making use of the StrivveCX standard JavaScript library and runtime.
