title: Strivve Components Introduction
---

Strivve's CardSavr Platform has pre-built components that make extending your applications faster and easier.

Of course, you can build custom cardholder experiences in whatever U/X framework is desired, by making use of the CardSavr SDK's and/or REST API's.

In many cases, both for prototyping and for production applications, using Strivve's pre-built components hides the complexities of the API's and come with tested and integrated functionality, saving the integration and testing efforts considerably.

## Strivve Components Types
There are two basic types of components available for use with the CardSavr Platform today.
* CardUpdatr: A Desktop and mobile iFrame workflow which comes with many configuration options and modes of operation.
* StrivveCX: Varying levels of customizable Javascript Components which easily drop into desktop and mobile web applications as well as native applications as reqired.
## CardUpdatr iFrame Drop-In Component

CardUpdatr operates in 3 major modes:
* Web linked to and from the CardSavr platform, within any web or mobile application
* Embedded into a page or area of a page within any web or mobile application
* Single Sign On for pulling card and billing address details from the banking application systems to avoid cardholder friction and minimize cardholder inputs
