## Lauching CardUpdatr from within your Application
There are several proposed methods from which you can integrate/launch CardUpdatr from you application.  The methods cover use cases from Mobile Applications, Mobile Web Applications, and Desktop Web applications.

### Mobile Application
Popup


### Mobile Web Application
Overlay


### Desktop Web Application
Overlay

### Embedded
CardUpdatr can be embedded within an iframe which is a legacy method of integrating into the desktop and mobile experience.  Although this method is still supported, Strivve recommends the [Mobile Application](#mobile-application), [Mobile Web Application](#mobile-web-application), and [Desktop Application](#desktop-web-application) experiences referenced in this document.

As CardUpdatr is inserted as an iframe, the boostrap library makes the insertion possible.  Use the code below in your page to host the CardUpdatr within an iframe.  You must create a div that has the correct height, and then pass the id of the div into the initCardupdatr function. 

```javascript
    <div class="container" style="background-color: deepskyblue; width: 100%; text-align: center; padding-top: 3vh; min-height: 100vh;">
    <!-- This script loads in from a .cardupdatr.app domain. -->
    <script src="https://CARDUPDATR_HOSTNAME.cardupdatr.app/cardupdatr-client.js"></script>
    <!-- Empty div to initialize the iFrame which loads CardUpdatr. -->
    <div class="cardupdatr-frame" id="cardupdatr-frame"></div>
    </div>
    <script>
      window.initCardupdatr(settings = { 
        config: { 
          app_container_id: "cardupdatr-frame", 
          hostname: "https://CARDUPDATR_HOSTNAME.cardupdatr.app/" 
        } 
      });
</script>
```

## CardUpdatr Single-Sign On


## CardUpdatr Configuration 
There are three sets of settings that can be used to customize your CardUpdatr experience, separated into different configuration objects.  The "user" object is for customer specific data required to authenticate SSO users and also to provide customer specific logging.  The "config" object (some settings required) configures the FI for which CardUpdatr should run, how sites should be sorted, and which countries should be supported.  "style_template" is used to dynamically configured messages, colors and background images.

CardUpdatr may also be configured statically in the [Partner Portal](/ops-admin/partner-portal/).  For more details, please contact [E-mail Strivve](mailto:support@strivve.com).
