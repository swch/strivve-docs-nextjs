The **CardSavr Platform** is a hybrid cloud platform built for card-on-file placements with U/X components, SDK's and a REST API built to help cardholders seamlessly update their new or reissued cards anywhere they pay online. Cardholders access CardSavr’s updating experience in the issuer’s various digital web and mobile experiences.

We use machine learning technology to build a crowdsourced database of automated robotic processes that can be performed on existing merchant sites. CardSavr does not require any opt-in integration with individual payment sites (aka billers and/or merchants).

Strivve's patented robotic process automation technology performs the card updates on the user’s merchant site accounts and places their card on the site, on their behalf. The entire process of updating payment information online is carried out in seconds.
