## Specific Strivve SDK's

### NodeJS SDK for CardSavr

This library is an implementation of the CardSavr API for Node.js or web applications. It contains methods for session management; security and cryptography; and resource retrieval, creation, updating, and deleting. By mangaging CardSavr's complex security requirements automatically, the JavaScript library greatly simplifies the implementation of CardSavr in your own app.

{% callout title="Please note!" %}
Most methods in this library are asynchronous and therefore return resolved promises. Each method's individual documentation will specify if it is asynchronous. Take a look at the Quick Start guide to get up and running with the CardSavr library.
