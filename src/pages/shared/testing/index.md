## Testing Your Integrations
CardSavr provides synthetic merchant sites within non-production environments .  
These sites allow you to test your CardSavr integration without using live merchant sites.

## Synthetic Sites
Synthetic sites are simple responsive web applications that support a number of 
different interactive use cases.  For example, you can emulate a TFA 
(One-Time-Password) within your system.

The following table shows the interactions support by synthetic sites:

| Synthetic Site | Capabilities 
-----------------|--------------
Basic Login | Mimics a site with only username/password login capabilities
Two-Factor-Authentication Login | Mimics a site that requires TFA as part of the login process

The behavior of synthetic sites (either basic login or TFA login) is controlled by the values that are entered into
the fields on the synthetic site.  Need to test a TFA site, just enter "tfa" for the password and the synthetic site 
will automatically prompt for a TFA. The behaviors are outlined below:

| Field | Value | Behavior
-----------------|--------------|---------------
Email | "good_email" | Will work with all scenarios
Email | Any value other than "good_email" | Will prompt for new credentials
Password | "no_tfa" | Will authentication without TFA
Password | "tfa" | Will require a TFA for authentication
Password | Any value other than "tfa" or "no_tfa" | Will prompt for new credentials
TFA | "1234" | Will authenticate user
TFA | Any value other than "1234" | Will prompt for TFA

### How To Use
You can post jobs to the synthetic site just like you would to a live merchant site.

First, ensure that you have all the objects need to post a job to the CardSavr API:

* User (must be created before the card or account object)
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe_123",
  "cardholder_safe_key": "sample_key",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "email": "jsmith@email.com",
  "role": "dev"
}
```
* Card
```json
{
"cardholder_id": 3,
"address_id": 2,
"pan": 4111111111111111,
"par": "Q1J4AwSWD4Dx6q1DTo0MB21XDAV76",
"cvv": "123",
"expiration_month": "05",
"expiration_year": "24"
}
```  
* Account (site_hostname=synthetic.site)
```json
{
"cardholder_id": 11,
"site_hostname": "synthetic.site",
"username": "john_smith123",
"password": "sample_password"
}
```

Once these three objects exist in the CardSavr platform, you can 
post a job with the user_id, card_id, and account_id, and 
a site_hostname=synthetic.site
```json
{
"user_id": 1,
"card_id": 1,
"account_id": 1,
"site_hostname": "Synthetic-Basic Login",
"requesting_brand": "abc"
}
``` 

Using the synthetic sites, you can test the user interactions 
within your application 

## Explore CardSavr API With Postman

CardSavr environments can be configured to work with tools such as Postman, curl, etc.  A Postman template collection of requests is available along with usage instructions at GitHub for the [Strive SDK Postman Samples](https://github.com/swch/Strivve-SDK/tree/master/postman-samples "Strivve-SDK") to aide in exploring the CardSavr API.
